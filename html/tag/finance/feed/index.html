<p>Today in the mid of Global Crisis, Supermarkets staff, Security Guards, Cleaners, Strata people, Bin truck drivers, Aged Care workers, Disability workers, Nurses, Doctors, Police Cops, Public Transport workers, Food/necessity carriers, drivers, cabbies, Emergency workers, Childcare workers, Airport workers, Teachers, Moms, Dads, Sister, Brothers, Children, friends are our new Heroes!!</p>
<p>Respect everyone for risking their lives for us and supporting our lives &amp; livelihood!! Instead, we are giving them anger, agony. They are doing their jobs &amp; are saviours!!</p>
<p>Whenever you see anyone of these, please respect and ask them for water or coffee or food. They have been working 24/7 and mostly without any time for basic nourishment.</p>
<p>Multiculturalism &amp; Respect for all is what I learnt by being an Australian!!</p>
<p>Let’s carry that spirit of care to everywhere around the world!!</p>
<p>If you have any elderly person or any self-isolating family living next to you, just focus on caring, supporting &amp; helping only 2 families &#8211; the ones living next door to your left &amp; right. Get them groceries, food, supplies when you’re getting for yours.</p>
<p>Get flowers for them today and say it &#8211; we’re there &amp; post pics, so others also do. I’m doing it today!!!</p>
<p>These small efforts can create a Human Chain of care, affection &amp; confidence in the community that come what may, we can stand against anything, because, we are together &amp; we’re not mere Indians, Asians, Pakistanis, Chinese, Koreans, Australians, Sikhs, Hindus, Christians, Muslims&#8230;</p>
<p>We are Global Citizens &amp; we care for everyone!!</p>
